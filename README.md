Submission for ACM-W Hackathon '24 @ATMOS
CareerQuest is a quiz based website which analyses one's interests and skills to provide the most suitable Engineering field option accordingly.</br></br>
Our algorithm analyses 4 metric of skill: </br>Logic and Mental ability
                                          </br>Creativity and Imagination
                                          </br>Mathematical ability
                                          </br>Knowledge on general Physics
</br></br>
We have associated each field as a combination of 2 of these skills. After the skill analysis, the result is displayed as the permutation of the 2 skill sets in which one scored the highest.
